NOTES ON UPGRADING

Note for 0.1.1

If you have already integrated the plugin and want to upgrade it to a newer version,
you must delete the Assets/Doublethink folder, then import the new package.


After upgrading, redo setup (click "Assets/Exernal Dependency Manager/Android Resolver/Force Resolve" on the menu).
Do this even if you had already done this before on this project.

IF YOU STILL HAVE PROBLEMS:

If you have problems packaging the google library in the mainTemplate, 
you can use the local library method, for example, https://maven.google.com is replaced with https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/

Before each packaging, check whether the following are added in the mainTemplate
credentials {
	username "xmiles-outside"
    password "xmiles-outside"
}
